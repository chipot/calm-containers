                    calm containers -- General informations --

I created calm containers because I felt like my code was yelling at me when I
was using sys/queue.h. Also, I hate the way sys/queue.h is intrusive and ask
you systematicly about the name of the pointer member. Futhermore, you can not
debug this kind of macro easily.

Then I decided to create yet another C container library, called "calm" because
they dont yelled at you, because all the names are lowercase.

-- vector.h --

Vector.h is a simple header file which try to mimic the std::vector of C++. At
the moment the usage of vector.h is similar to the use of an explicit template
instantiation of a std::vector.

-- map.h --

Map.h is a stupid and simple implementation of an associative container. The
implementation is currently based on vector.h and the interface is pretty poor
at the moment.

Take a look at the tests and examples !
